**Objective:**
Achieve almost complete separation between the disk operations, module interactions, and shell environments. This separation enhances security, modularity, and maintainability.

### 1. **Disk Operations:**
The disk operations should be abstracted so that the actual file system is completely decoupled from the rest of the application logic. This can be achieved by using **File System Abstraction Layers (FSAL)** like `OSFS` or custom classes that interact with the disk but expose only necessary operations.

**Approach:**
- Use a **virtualized file system** to perform disk operations in a controlled manner (e.g., reading, writing, moving files).
- Ensure the file system operations are isolated from other system components. For example, when files are copied, moved, or archived, the actual file system should remain transparent to the user or the application.
- Prevent direct access to the underlying file system using standard `os` or `shutil` operations by wrapping these modules with custom classes.

**Key Points:**
- **File System Abstraction**: Use custom file system classes to ensure all file interactions go through the abstraction layer.
- **Isolation**: The file system layer should not allow direct interaction with the physical storage without going through the defined API.
- **File Operation Redirection**: Re-direct standard file operations (e.g., `open`, `copy`, `remove`, etc.) to use the virtualized file system.

### 2. **Modules Separation:**
Modules should be completely isolated and abstracted from one another. This can be achieved by creating custom wrapper modules that interact with each other only through a defined interface, ensuring that dependencies are minimal and each module performs its intended function without interfering with others.

**Approach:**
- **Wrapper Modules**: Create wrapper modules that expose the functionality of standard libraries (`os`, `shutil`, `subprocess`, etc.) via controlled interfaces. For example, the `Os` class abstracts `os` functions to work only through custom methods like `path_join`, `remove`, `rename`, etc.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module should only be responsible for its own domain and should not rely on or interfere with the internal workings of other modules.
- **Minimal Dependency**: Ensure minimal coupling between modules. Use dependency injection or direct passing of required objects to allow modules to work together in a non-invasive manner.

**Key Points:**
- **Custom Modules**: Replace standard modules like `os`, `shutil`, etc., with custom implementations that interact with the file system abstraction.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulate internal logic within modules so that external components (or other modules) do not need to be aware of how things work internally.
- **Standard Libraries Wrapped**: Instead of directly importing libraries like `os`, import your own custom wrappers that expose only necessary functionalities.

### 3. **Shell Environment Separation:**
The shell environment (i.e., command execution and interaction) should be abstracted and controlled to prevent unauthorized or insecure operations. The interaction with the shell should be done in a way that protects the system from external processes and only allows safe, controlled commands.

**Approach:**
- **Subprocess Control**: Disable or tightly control subprocess creation to prevent external commands from executing unless explicitly allowed. For example, use `subprocess` replacement with a custom function that restricts which commands can be run.
- **Command Execution Isolation**: Prevent arbitrary code execution by wrapping the shell interaction within a sandboxed environment. Only allow pre-approved commands to be executed, such as commands for interacting with the virtualized file system or custom modules.
- **Interactive Consoles**: If interactive consoles are used, ensure that the commands entered are sandboxed and do not have access to critical system resources unless necessary.

**Key Points:**
- **Shell Environment Protection**: Disable or limit subprocess and shell environment access to reduce security risks.
- **Sandboxing**: Use sandboxing techniques to ensure commands executed in the shell or console cannot affect the system outside their defined environment.
- **Controlled Interactions**: Allow only safe interactions between the system and external or user commands by wrapping shell functions and limiting access to essential tools.

### 4. **Security and Isolation:**
By achieving this level of separation between disk, modules, and shell, you can create a more secure and controlled environment. This makes it harder for malicious actors to interact with the system or compromise its integrity.

**Approach:**
- **File System Protection**: Prevent unauthorized access to the physical file system by using controlled access points through the abstraction layer.
- **Module Integrity**: Ensure that only trusted modules interact with each other. Avoid exposing sensitive operations to untrusted modules or external users.
- **Shell Command Limitation**: Restrict the execution of commands that can compromise the system. Only allow pre-configured commands to interact with the system, and ensure any external process interactions are validated and secure.

**Key Points:**
- **Least Privilege**: Operate each layer with the least privileges required to perform the task, minimizing potential risks.
- **Audit and Logging**: Implement logging to track interactions with each layer (disk, modules, and shell), allowing for auditing and quick identification of potential security issues.
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Design each separation point with fail-safes to prevent accidental or malicious disruption of the system.

### Conclusion:
By applying **high-level separation** across disk operations, module interactions, and shell environments, the system becomes more secure, flexible, and maintainable. This design principle helps:
- Protect sensitive system resources from external threats.
- Facilitate easier debugging and maintenance by ensuring components are self-contained.
- Enhance modularity and scalability, allowing different components to evolve independently.
